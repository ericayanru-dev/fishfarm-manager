# fishfarm-manager
fishfarm-manager is a frontend fish farm management system built with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, and a minimal Node.js server. It mirrors a Python-based system to manage fish stock, feed purchases, feed usage, sales, reports, and profit calculations, with persistent storage via LocalStorage and a phased feature roadmap.
